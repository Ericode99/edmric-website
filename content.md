### About EDMric

EDMric always liked music. As a child he played the piano and in high school he sang in the choir. He also produced some very simple remixes of popular pop songs and took a dj course.

EDMric loves EDM songs and listenes to EDM all the time when he's at the gym, doing chores or driving the car. But in his opinion there are too few EDM songs that he relly likes, wich is why he started producing some himself.

### The EDM Genre

EDM stands for Electronix dance music and is made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. Despite the music industries attemt to create a specific EDM brand, it remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including dance-pop, house, techno and electro, as well as their respective subgenres.

Following the emergence of raving, pirate radio, PartyCrews, underground festivals and an upsurge of interest in club culture during the late 1980s and early 1990s, EDM achived mainstream popularity in Europe.

In the United States however, the government tryed to halt the spread of rave culture due to it being linked to drug use. It was not until the early 2000s that EDM rose to mainstream popularity in the US.
